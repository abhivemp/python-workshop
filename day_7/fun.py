"""
Model a basic company hierarchy where different employee roles have different information associated with them.

Create a base Employee class. Then, create at least two specialized subclasses, such as Manager and Developer. A manager should be associated with a department, and a developer should be associated with a primary programming language. The program should be able to display a complete profile for any employee object.

Example Run:
mgr [ Name: Alice, ID: M001, Department: Engineering ]
dev [ Name: Bob, ID: D012, Language: Python ]
