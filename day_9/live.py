import pandas

# pip: THE PACKAGE INSTALLER

# Use `pip` to install external libraries from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
# For example: `pip install requests`
# After installation, you can `import` and use the library in your code.

# virtualenv / venv: ISOLATED ENVIRONMENTS

# Virtual environments help manage dependencies on a per-project basis.
# Use `venv` or `virtualenv` to create an environment, activate it, and install packages inside.

# Benefits:
# - Avoids conflicts between projects
# - Keeps your global Python installation clean
# - Easy to reproduce environments using `requirements.txt`
